# What's New in 0.57-beta "Renovation"

**Released:** October 6, 2025
**Codename:** Renovation
**Focus:** Documentation Overhaul

---

## Welcome to Version 0.57! 📚

This release is **all about documentation**. We haven't added new features—instead, we've completely renovated the documentation to make Hei-DataHub **dramatically more accessible and user-friendly**.

**What's changed:** Every feature that shipped in v0.56.0-beta (Oct 5, 2025) now has complete, step-by-step guides with examples, troubleshooting tips, and reference pages.

**The result:** You can finally discover and master inline editing, advanced search, themes, and keybindings without digging through code or guessing how things work.

## ⚠️ Known Issues (from v0.56)

These issues were introduced in v0.56.0-beta and are now **properly documented** with workarounds:

1. **Restart required for theme/keybinding changes** – Fix planned for v0.58
2. **Edit form doesn't scroll on small screens** – Some fields may be hidden
3. **Nested fields not editable** – Arrays like `schema_fields` can't be edited yet
4. **PR success shows as failure** – Check GitHub directly to verify
5. **Edited datasets revert after closing app** – Under investigation for v0.57.1
6. **Git branch not switched after PR** – Manual branch switch needed
7. **Metadata doesn't auto-refresh** – Run `hei-datahub reindex` manually
8. **Search field autocomplete not available** – Planned for future release
